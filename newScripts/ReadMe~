This ReadMe details all scripts in this folders setup, functions, and known bugs.

Setup:
Make sure /usr/local/VisIt/bin/ is in the path, this can be checked with the
code showpath.sh
These scripts run in python2.7 (curse the VisIt devs) 

edit the rconfig.input and domainchangeconfig.input files to have the initial
conditions you would like.

-Format of rconfig.input-
path to VisIt site-packages
path to data 
name of images produced 
save location of images
variable 
min var
max var
min thresh
max thresh 

see VisIt mannual for more info on var and thresh 

-Format of domainchangeconfig.input-
file being changed
export location 

For use of gifmaker.py use command:
python2.7 -m pip install PIL

Function:

-RenderLoad.py-
Runs all scripts in the correct order and allows for automation of all scripts.
userIn - sets initial input for automation, can be ignored if not automating 
auto - toggles menu of RenderLoad.py off if set to True
autoRender - makes menus inside other scripts automatic if set to True 

-RenderCD.py-
Renders data that has had the changing domain cut into small pieces 
Visitoff() - Kills the PID for visit as a memory leak failsafe 
(The visit devs did not do a good job of preventing this situation)
main(auto) - Runs visit with settings specified by rconfig.input, auto allows
for the skipping of the rconfig.input setup process 

-RenderSd.py- 
Renders data that has a static domain. Does not cause memory leaks ever.
smain(auto) - Same as main(), but for RenderCD.py
No need for Visitoff(), because this method of saving does not cause 
memory leaks 

-Domainchange.py-
Cuts .visit files with changing domains into FVD#.visit files with constant 
domains.
Active() - This function runs the whole code, this was done so that 
Domainchange.py could just be run as a function inside RenderLoad.py 

-gifmaker.py-
Creates .gif files from the images generated from the VisIt render process
useri - y/n for .gif creation, default to y (str)
total - sets duration (int) 
name - sets name (str)
gifCreate(useri, total, name) - creates .gif with provided info

-ModuleLoad.py-
Automatically loads the visit module for the user. Wheeler specifc.
loadv() - loads visit module to Wheeler 
unload() - unloads visit module from Wheeler
 
-showpath.sh-
Lists out what is in your path. Helpful for checking if visit is in the 
path.

-visitlog.py- 
VisIt's automatically generated data cache for renders. Useful for 
debugging and learning the VisIt commands. Why can't you use the VisIt 
documentaion? Because a lot of it is very outdated...

Bugs:
if initial unchanged .visit file is left in the folder with FVD#.visit files 
VisIt will throw a render error when it attempts to render it. The solution 
is to move the .visit file to another folder after the domain change.
(this could be automated in the future)

VisIt's current install on Wheeler doesn't render anything due to some files 
missing. This is by far and away the largest error, because this code
currently doesn't do anything. This is being fixed.

Image folder doesn't get created and no images are rendered. This is most 
likely tied to the bug mentioned above; However, this can't be confirmed 
or denied until the VisIt install is corrected and and the scripts ran
again.
